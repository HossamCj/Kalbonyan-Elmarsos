* The Quicksort:
    - Divide-and-conquer algorithm, like the merge sort.
    - Also uses recursion to perform sorting.
    
    - Generally performs better than merge sort, O(n log n).
    - Operates in place in data.
    
    - Worst case in O(n2) when data is mostly sorted already.


* The Quicksort: Pivot Point Selection

* A programmer needs to organize a data set. How will a quick sort accomplish this?
    - It will use a pivot point and move items that are on the wrong side 
      of the pivot value by using high and low index values.

    - A quick sort sets a pit point to partition a data set.
      High and low index values are then used to rearrange data values that are on the "wrong" side of the pivot point.


* How does the required time for a merge sort grow with the size of the data set?
    - logarithmic-linear
