* Recursion:
    - Recursive functions need to have a breaking condition.
    - This prevents infinite loops and eventual crashes.
    - Each time the function is called, the old arguments are saved.
    - This is called the "Call Stack"


* Simple function to understand the recursion more from ZeroWebSchool Channel:

    def cleanword(word):

        if len(word) == 1:
            return word
        
        if word[0] == word[1]:
            return cleanword(word[1:])
    
        return word[0] + cleanword(word[1:])
