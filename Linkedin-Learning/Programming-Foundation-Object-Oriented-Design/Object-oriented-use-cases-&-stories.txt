    Solution 1:
        - As a user, I want my song to be added to the front of a long play queue,
            So that I don't have to wait for hours to hear it.

        * From Usaibility standpoint:
            - As a user, I want to be identified without my touching  anything,
                 So that my hands can do other things.
            
            - As a user, I want to sort  and browse songs by artist,
                So that I can listen to every song by the artist.
